## Mission

Share goofiness in regards to LGBTQ labels, then have a followup tweet to define the label. Also have a "this day in queer history" set of tweets


![Screeshot of tweets: "today's queerness is a high af genderqueer Sega" "today's queerness is a biromatic flannel shirt" "today's queerness is a blobby demigirl N64"](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/294564715/007d7100-f804-11ea-88b4-d5cc00092fcb)
