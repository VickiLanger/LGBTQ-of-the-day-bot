# TODO: add more events, their dates, and a reference link

# NOTE: syntax--> 'MM-DD': 'Name of day \n relevant hashtag',  # reference link, if you have one
# NOTE: place events in order
# NOTE: must fit in a tweet, so not longer than this line -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

# NOTE: For events that are on a nth day of the month (like 2nd Tuesday of November), the syntax is 'MM-xY' where x is the week number and Y is the day of the week
#       denoted by MTWRFSU - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, thuRsday, Friday, Saturday, sUnday
#       Example - 2nd Tuesday of November would be listed as '11-2T'

# NOTE: If multiple events fall on the same date, convert that entry to a list
#       e.g. 'mm-dd': [events]
#       Or, if an event already exists in this list, convert it
#       from 'mm-dd': 'old event'
#       to 'mm-dd': ['old event',
#                   'new event 1',
#                   'new event 2',
